### PROJECT
### TITLE: DEPLOYMENT OF VAGRANT UBUNTU CLUSTER WITH LAMPSTACK

## Task and Objective: 
-Create a bashscript to ochestrate the automated deployment of two vagrant-based Ubuntu syatems, designated as "Master" and "Slave"  respectively with an integrated LAMPSTACK on both systems.

## SPECIFICATIONS:
# Infrastructure Configurations:
-Deploy two ubuntu systems; master node(this node should be capable of acting as a control system), and slave node(this node should be managed by the master node).

## User Management:
# On the master node:
-Create a user named "altschool"
-Grant the altschool user root (superuser) privileges.

# Internode Communication:
-Enable SSH key based authentication;
The master node (altschool user) should seamlessly SSH into the slave node without requiring a password.

## Data Management and Transfer:
# On Initiation;
-Copy the contents of the '/mnt/Altschool' directory from the master node to '/mnt/altschool/slave' on the slave node.
This operation should be performed  using the altschool user from the master node.

# Process Monitoring:
-The master node should display an overview of the linux process management showcasing currently running processes.

# LAMPSTACK Deployment:
-Install a LAMP (linux, apache, mySQL, pHp) stack on both nodes.
-Ensure apache is running and set to start on boot.
-Secure the mySQL installation and initialize it with a default user and password.
-Validate pHp functionality with apache.

# Deliverables:
-A bashscript encapsulatng the entire deployment process adhering to the specifications above.
-Documentation accompanying the script elucidiating the steps and procedures for execution.
